# TBall-Lineups
An application that generates random tball and baseball positions for a youth tball/baseball team.  Coding and UI design is 100% my own and was a handy application to use for myself and other coaches coaching our boys tball/baseball teams.

# Functionality
Enter team name, amount of innings, whether there should be a Catcher or not, and player names, click button.  The application takes the input from the user, generates a completely randomized tball/baseball lineup and random positions for all the players for the amount of innings entered. UI created with fully responsive web design to work on all devices.

After lineups are generated, you can edit an inidividual field by clicking in it, or edit all fields for a player by clicking edit button.  When your edited positions and lineups are set, you can click the Print Lineups button to print as many copies you need for gametime!
